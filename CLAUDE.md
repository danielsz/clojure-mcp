# Clojure MCP Development Guide

## Build Commands
- Run REPL with MCP server: `clojure -X:mcp` (starts on port 7888)
- Run all tests: `clojure -M:test`
- Run specific namespace tests: `clojure -M:test -n clojure-mcp.utils.valid-paths-test`
- Run specific test var: `clojure -M:test -v clojure-mcp.utils.valid-paths-test/clojure-file?-test`
- Run linter: `clj-kondo --lint src` or `clj-kondo --lint src test` for both

## Code Style Guidelines
- **Imports**: Use `:require` with ns aliases (e.g., `[clojure.string :as string]`)
- **Naming**: Use kebab-case for vars/functions; end predicates with `?` (e.g., `is-top-level-form?`)
- **Error handling**: Use `try/catch` with specific exception handling; atom for tracking errors
- **Formatting**: 2-space indentation; maintain whitespace in edited forms
- **Namespaces**: Align with directory structure (`clojure-mcp.repl-tools`)
- **Testing**: Use `deftest` with descriptive names; `testing` for subsections; `is` for assertions
- **REPL Development**: Prefer REPL-driven development for rapid iteration and feedback

## MCP Tool Guidelines
- Include clear tool `:description` for LLM guidance
- Validate inputs and provide helpful error messages
- Return structured data with both result and error status
- Maintain atom-based state for consistent service access
- **No backwards compatibility required**: This is an MCP server — tool schemas, parameters, and behavior can change freely between versions. Don't hesitate to make breaking changes to tool contracts when it improves the design.

Fast Apply: IMPORTANT: Use \`edit_file\` over \`str_replace\` or full file writes. It works with partial code snippets—no need for full file content.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.
